# reviewer_randomizer

This script takes in a list of applicants, a list of reviewers, and the number of people to be assigned to each applicant. Reviewers are then randomly assigned to the applicants. Two output tables are saved: (1) a table of applicants followed by assigned reviewers and (2) a table of reviewers followed by assigned applicants. *These two tables contain the same information in different formats.*

The `reviewer_randomizer_GoogleColab.py` script can be run from the command line but the script needs to be edited first to change the inputs since they are hard coded.

To run the script from an editable jupyter notebook in your web browser use [this google colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17uKKnFAhS8MqKoNv1NC1AT_mjG3Ue4nh). Note that this is EDITABLE. If you break it, it's up to you to fix it. The original version is saved in this github - use that to fix the shared notebook.
